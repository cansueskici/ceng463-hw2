# CENG463-Programming Assignment 2

Welcome to the CENG463 Programming Assignment 2! The project involves classifying texts using a multilingual masked language model and a multilingual causal language model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify texts for two tasks in both their original language and in English. The project utilizes Multilingual BERT as masked language model and Llama-3.1-8B for multilingual causal language model.

1. **Task 1**: Classifying texts to determine the ideology of the speaker.
2. **Task 2**: Classifying texts to determine if the speech is in favor of opposition or governing.

## Project Structure
- `task1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Task 1 with Multilingual BERT.
- `task1_inference.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Task 1 with Llama-3.1-8B.
- `task2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Task 2, with Multilingual BERT.
- `task2_inference.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Task 2 Llama-3.1-8B

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Scikit-learn
